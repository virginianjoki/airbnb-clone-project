PROJECT OVERVIEW:Airbnb Clone

The Airbnb Clone is a full-stack web application inspired by the core functionalities of the Airbnb platform.
This project simulates a real-world booking system, enabling users to list, browse, and reserve accommodations.
It provides hands-on experience in building scalable, secure, and production-ready applications, reflecting best practices in modern software development.

PROJECT GOALS
-Recreate the core features of a booking platform such as user authentication, property listing, search, and reservations.
-Strengthen team collaboration using GitHub and agile workflows.
-Design and implement robust backend architecture with a well-structured database.
-Ensure application security through proper API protection and data validation.
-Automate development and deployment using CI/CD pipelines.
-Document development processes and maintain high project clarity and organization.

Technology Stack
This project utilizes a modern, scalable, and secure technology stack to recreate the core functionality of a booking platform like Airbnb. Each component plays a crucial role in building and maintaining the application:

Django
Purpose: Django is a high-level Python web framework used for developing the backend of the application. It provides built-in tools for handling user authentication, routing, and database interactions, enabling rapid and secure API development.

MySQL
Purpose: MySQL is a robust and widely-used relational database system. It stores structured data for users, listings, bookings, and more. It supports complex queries and ensures data integrity and scalability.

GraphQL
Purpose: GraphQL is an API query language that allows clients to request only the data they need. It enhances the flexibility and efficiency of client-server communication, especially in applications with nested or related data structures.

Docker
Purpose: Docker is used to containerize the application, ensuring consistency across development and production environments. It simplifies deployment and makes the system easier to manage and scale.

GitHub & Git
Purpose: Git is the version control system used to track changes in the project. GitHub hosts the repository, enabling collaboration, pull requests, and issue tracking for a smooth team workflow.

GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
Purpose: GitHub Actions automates testing, building, and deployment of the application through CI/CD pipelines. This ensures fast, reliable, and error-free deployments to production environments.

API Security Practices
Purpose: Security measures such as JWT authentication, HTTPS, and input validation are integrated to protect sensitive user data and prevent unauthorized access or attacks like SQL injection or CSRF.
