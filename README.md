Technology Stack
This project utilizes a modern, scalable, and secure technology stack to recreate the core functionality of a booking platform like Airbnb. Each component plays a crucial role in building and maintaining the application:

Django
Purpose: Django is a high-level Python web framework used for developing the backend of the application. It provides built-in tools for handling user authentication, routing, and database interactions, enabling rapid and secure API development.

MySQL
Purpose: MySQL is a robust and widely-used relational database system. It stores structured data for users, listings, bookings, and more. It supports complex queries and ensures data integrity and scalability.

GraphQL
Purpose: GraphQL is an API query language that allows clients to request only the data they need. It enhances the flexibility and efficiency of client-server communication, especially in applications with nested or related data structures.

Docker
Purpose: Docker is used to containerize the application, ensuring consistency across development and production environments. It simplifies deployment and makes the system easier to manage and scale.

GitHub & Git
Purpose: Git is the version control system used to track changes in the project. GitHub hosts the repository, enabling collaboration, pull requests, and issue tracking for a smooth team workflow.

GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
Purpose: GitHub Actions automates testing, building, and deployment of the application through CI/CD pipelines. This ensures fast, reliable, and error-free deployments to production environments.

API Security Practices
Purpose: Security measures such as JWT authentication, HTTPS, and input validation are integrated to protect sensitive user data and prevent unauthorized access or attacks like SQL injection or CSRF.

Feature Breakdown
The Airbnb Clone project is designed to replicate the core features of a modern online booking platform. Below are the primary features and how they contribute to the user experience and backend functionality:

User Management
Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles. Hosts can list properties, while guests can make bookings, leave reviews, and manage their reservations. Secure authentication ensures data protection and role-based access control.

Property Management
Hosts can list new properties with detailed descriptions, pricing, and location data. Each property is linked to a host and can be edited or removed as needed, providing full CRUD functionality.

Booking System
Guests can check availability and make bookings for listed properties. The system prevents double-booking and includes status tracking (e.g., pending, confirmed, cancelled) to keep hosts and guests informed.

Payment Integration
A secure payment module allows users to make payments for their bookings. Each transaction is linked to a booking and user, supporting tracking, status verification, and receipt generation.

Reviews and Ratings
Guests can leave reviews and rate properties after their stay. These reviews help improve trust in the platform and guide other users in choosing accommodations.

API Security
The project includes security measures such as JWT authentication, input validation, and role permissions. This ensures that only authorized users can perform actions like creating bookings or editing properties.

CI/CD Integration
Automated CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions help streamline development and deployment. This ensures that new changes are tested and deployed efficiently with minimal downtime or manual intervention.

API Security
Security is a core part of any application that handles sensitive user data, financial transactions, and user-generated content. Below are the key security measures implemented to protect the Airbnb Clone backend:

Authentication
-Implementation: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are used to securely identify users after login.
-Why it matters: Ensures that only registered users can access protected routes and perform actions like booking or reviewing properties.

Authorization
-Implementation: Role-based access control (RBAC) distinguishes between guests and hosts.
-Why it matters: Prevents users from performing unauthorized actions, such as a guest editing another host’s property or accessing admin-only features.

Rate Limiting
-Implementation: Limits the number of requests a user/IP can make within a time window.
-Why it matters: Protects the API from brute-force attacks, abuse, or denial-of-service (DoS) attempts.

Input Validation & Sanitization
-Implementation: All user inputs are validated and cleaned before being processed or stored.
-Why it matters: Prevents common attacks such as SQL injection, XSS (cross-site scripting), and data corruption.

Secure Payment Handling
-Implementation: Payment processing (if simulated) uses tokenized operations and secure endpoints.
-Why it matters: Ensures financial data is transmitted and stored safely, reducing the risk of fraud and identity theft.

HTTPS Enforcement
-Implementation: All requests will be forced over HTTPS in production.
-Why it matters: Encrypts all communication between client and server, safeguarding sensitive data like passwords and payment details.

Environment Variables
-Implementation: Secret keys, database credentials, and API tokens are stored in environment variables.
-Why it matters: Keeps sensitive credentials out of the codebase, reducing the risk of accidental exposure.

CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes. This ensures that the application is always in a deployable state, reduces manual errors, and allows for faster feature delivery.

CI/CD importance
Improved code quality: Automated testing helps catch bugs early before deployment.
Faster development: Developers can push changes more frequently without worrying about manual deployment steps.
Consistent deployments: Ensures the same setup is used across development, testing, and production environments.

Tools Used
GitHub Actions: Automates the pipeline to run tests and deployments on every push or pull request.
Docker: Containerizes the app for consistent performance across environments.
Heroku / Render / AWS (optional): Can be used as deployment platforms to host the live application.
